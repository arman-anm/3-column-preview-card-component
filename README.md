### What I learned

```css
/* In CSS */

ELEMENT > element {
  padding: 10px;
}

/* Is not the same as  */

ELEMENT element {
 padding: 10px
}
```

The first one is [Direct child Selector](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp) & the second one is [Descendant Selector](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp). 

In one line of my code I've used
```css
.wrapper-cards * {
  padding: calc(var(--padding-default) * 2);
}
```
and expected to have some padding to the child cards of the wrapper. Which of course didn't happen. Instead it applied padding to all the elements. Then i've added one single character to the code;
```css
.wrapper-cards > * {
  padding: calc(var(--padding-default) * 2);
}
```
 Literally just ONE character which is '>' and voila, it fixed my broken page instantly. 
 
Now, should i get amazed about how powerful just one piece of character is? Or get freaked out about how powerful just ONE piece of character is?
